## What is PocketByte?
[PocketByte](https://pocketbyte.co) is an open-source indie video game console with swappable inputs and infinite software. Built for makers, anyone can create and share their own games, software, or IoT applications.

Unlike any other console, PocketByte includes a controller module port that enables users to build their own custom controllers and hook it up to the console, paving the way for entirely new experiences.

### Hardware Specifications
PocketByte DevKits, soon to be available on our store, currently have the following specifications:

- [Dual-core ESP32-S3-WROOM-1-N16R8](https://documentation.espressif.com/esp32-s3-wroom-1_wroom-1u_datasheet_en.pdf)
- 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi
- Bluetooth 5.0
- 8 MB of RAM
- 16 MB of PSRAM
- 2.0" 320x240 TFT LCD panel
- Micro SD card slot
- USB-C 2.0
- 1500 mAh rechargeable LiPo battery
- 6-axis IMU with a gyroscope and accelerometer
- Piezoelectric buzzer (can be used as a back tap sensor as well)

PocketByte is suitable for high-performance video games and wireless applications. The only limit to what you can build is your creativity. Of course, you can always go small and simple as well.

### Controller Modules

Currently, the only available controller module is a gamepad with a d-pad and four face buttons.

Another controller module to be available soon is a BlackBerry-like QWERTY keyboard based on the TCA8418.
